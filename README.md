# Peter Romo's Portfolio

Hello there! 
Thanks for checking out my personal portfolio!
<br>

I am from San Deigo, California.

I grew up at a young age learning by taking apart old telephones, TV's and radios, dissecting the circutry.  
Occasionally, I had success when I put it back together.  
In my early teens I self taught what the components actually did, and the success rate of putting-together drastically improved.

Some of my scope of hobby activities have broadened since to include 3-d printing, prototype manufacturing, but at its core retains a curiosity to understand how things work at its most granular level.

I used to work in manufacturing, where I enjoyed going to work in a fast paced enviroment like a "How it's Made" episode.

I pride myself on being mechanically handy.  I recently built a shed to house my metal & wood working tools, micro tesla coils and laser cutter.

I self-taught to play the violin and piano during the Covid Pandemic.

Lastly, and most importantly, I am a recent dog person convert and have adopted an elderly collie mix named Sadie. In spite of her years, She is a strong canidate for being taught new tricks.

<br>

I am also a full-stack software developer with a passion for problem solving in React, Ruby & Rails, Javascript,  Redux, HTML.

<br>

Currently, I am focusing on learning more in React Native, and rails. I strive always keep learning more!
